# GUI-application-with-Python-3

LoadingUI.py: This file contains all necessary commands to load a .ui file. You just need to add your commands and codes to build your GUI application given that your User inteface (.ui) has been already designed. 

plot-Converted.py: This is the python file related to the example that we first converted ui to python file. Please watch https://youtu.be/v3_N4t-WdWU

"To convert your UI to a python file, open Anaconda Prompt, then go to the folder that holds your .ui file. Finally, type the following command: 
pyuic5 -x -o name.py yourUI.ui"

plot-loadingUI.py: This is the python file related to the example that we only load our ui without any conversion. In this example, we also saw how we can add Message box to our GUI application. Please watch https://youtu.be/Y2iUHLgLOas

plot.ui: It is the user interface I have created using QT Designer.
